It then iterates over the rest of the rows in the input grid. If a row contains all zeros except for the first and last elements, it replaces that row with the row above it in the output grid. Otherwise, it adds the row to the output grid as is. Finally, it replaces the first and last elements of each row in the output grid with the corresponding elements from the input grid.",
